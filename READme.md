# 🚖 **Uber Fares Dataset Analysis using Power BI** 📊

## Project Overview 📝

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the **Uber Fares Dataset** to uncover insights into fare amounts, ride durations, and various operational metrics. We’ve used **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard that visually represents these findings and provides data-driven recommendations for improving Uber's operational strategies.

## **Methodology** 🔧

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation** 📥

* **Dataset Source**: The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle: [Uber Fares Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset).
* **Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset into **Python** using **Pandas** for initial exploration and data cleaning.
* **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, identified and managed outliers, and applied necessary transformations.
* **Feature Engineering**: Extracted new features such as **hour**, **day**, **month**, and **day of the week** from timestamps.
* **Export for Power BI**: Saved the cleaned data as a **CSV** file, which was later imported into **Power BI**.

---

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍

* **Descriptive Statistics**: Computed the **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **standard deviation**, and **quartiles**.
* **Fare Distribution**: Created **visualizations** such as histograms and box plots to understand fare distribution.
* **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed relationships between variables like fare amount and distance, time of day, and duration.

*This visual shows fare patterns across different days, hours, months, and weekdays.*

### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️

* **Timestamp Extraction**: Created features such as **hour**, **day**, **month**, and **day of the week** to analyze temporal trends.
* **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded for Power BI analysis.
* **Peak/Off-Peak Indicators**: Identified peak and off-peak times to provide a better understanding of demand periods.

## **Data Analysis in Power BI** 💡

### Key Visualizations:

* **Fare Distribution**: Fare amounts were visualized using histograms and box plots.
* **Ride Duration**: Time-based analysis of ride durations.
* **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzed temporal patterns, showing peaks during specific hours, days, and months.

## **Results** 🎯

The analysis produced key insights into Uber fare patterns and ride frequencies:

1. **Peak Fare Periods**: Late nights and early mornings exhibit higher fare amounts due to surge pricing and demand.
2. **Busiest Days**: Weekdays, especially Thursdays and Fridays, experienced the highest number of rides.
3. **Fare Fluctuations**: Fare amounts were significantly higher in December due to holiday demand.
4. **Ride Duration Insights**: The average ride duration varies based on the time of day, with longer trips occurring during certain hours.

## **Recommendations** 💡

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

* **Dynamic Pricing Optimization**: Surge pricing can be optimized by targeting peak hours with higher fares to maximize revenue.
* **Targeted Promotions**: Off-peak months can benefit from marketing promotions to boost ridership.
* **Geographical Analysis**: By analyzing ride frequency across regions, Uber can adjust its service offerings for areas with lower ride volume.

## **Conclusion** 🏁

The **Uber Fares Dataset** analysis has provided valuable insights into **fare patterns**, **ride frequencies**, and **peak demand periods**. The **interactive Power BI dashboard** allows Uber to visualize and make strategic decisions based on the data-driven findings. By optimizing pricing strategies and targeting specific periods and regions, Uber can enhance its operational efficiency and customer experience.

## **Terminal Code Output Placeholder** 💻

Here’s where you can add terminal outputs such as data cleaning, feature extraction, or other relevant code operations. Below is an example placeholder:

```bash
# Example Terminal Output Placeholder
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> data = pd.read_csv('uber_fares.csv')
>>> data.info()  # Information about the dataset
>>> data.isnull().sum()  # Check for missing values
>>> data['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(data['pickup_datetime']).dt.hour  # Extract hour
>>> data.head()  # Preview the data after cleaning
```
